Firma: Civilization is an Addon/Expansion for TerraFirmaCraft.

It is themed around adding features to TerraFirmaCraft that focus on organic multiplayer experiences where players working together will be able to accomplish more than the sum of their parts.


Currently in early, early, and for emphasis, EARLY, alpha. I have not modded Minecraft before. Please do not use outside of test settings. Back up your worlds.


Module 1: Watercraft Overhaul
 - Adds a dugout canoe that can be created by right-clicking on 3 horizontal stripped logs in a row

Module 1 Roadmap:
 - Complete Canoe functionality:
  - Add Paddle item
  - Change movement characteristics
  - More players paddling makes it faster
  - Conversion of stripped logs to canoe components will take a few seconds
  - Conversion of stripped logs to canoe components will require at least a copper axe
